# Realtime AI

A real-time Agent framework for audio and video.

**Note that this project is under active development.**

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main components:

- **AI SDK (WebRTC)**: Captures and processes audio and video streams on the client side using the WebRTC protocol, including tasks such as audio/video encoding and preliminary inference.

- **WebRTC Gateway**: Manages signaling, handles NAT/firewall traversal, and forwards media streams. It also supports load balancing with the AI Service.

- **AI Service**: Provides real-time inference and data processing capabilities, including speech recognition, image recognition, real-time subtitle generation, speech synthesis, and interactive real-time large model interactions.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use with straightforward integration.

- **WebRTC-Based Transmission**: Utilizes WebRTC for audio and video transmission and employs Data Channels for signaling.

- **Flexible AI Pipeline**: AI services are processed through a pipeline architecture, allowing for customizable and modular assembly.

- **Optimized for Real-Time Scenarios**: Specifically engineered to meet the demands of real-time applications, ensuring low latency and high performance.
